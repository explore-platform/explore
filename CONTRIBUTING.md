## How can I contribute

### Suggesting enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the information detailed information.

### Contributions 

EXPLORE adopts the Developer Certificate of Origin ([DCO](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/dco)) to facilitate contributions from the community. 
The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Here is the full text of the DCO, reformatted for readability: https://developercertificate.org/

We use the [DCO app](https://github.com/apps/dco) to enforce the DCO on Pull Requests.
It requires all commit messages to contain the Signed-off-by line with an email address that matches the commit author.

## How to submit changes

Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository!
 
1. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository**. This makes your own version of this project you can edit and use.

3. **Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)**. This opens a discussion around your project and lets the project lead know you are proposing changes.

Trademarks are adjectives that alter nouns. The latter refer to the generic name of a product or service. Thus, trademarks are not nouns and may therefore not be used as a generic term. Proper use of these trademarks reinforces their role as brands.
The first time a trademark is used, and as reasonable after that, it should be followed by the common generic (the dictionary name) term of the product. E.g. the EXPLORE&#8480; platform allows to deploy the G-Arch&#8480; scientific data application.
